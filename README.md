# Web-Development Study Tool


## Description

Our primary motivation was to provide an intuitive, visually clear and useful tool for students learning how to code. This project is created by eDX Bootcamp students hoping to improve the strenuous coding journey for current and future learners. To the best of our ability, we perfected a Website using YouTube and Wikipedia APIs, to supply users with sufficient information to their queries.
This journey taught us how to co-operate as a team and gave us the opportunity to understand the usage of GitHub in professional settings; especially branching. It also further developed our previous knowledge, learning from one another during pair programming practise and helped identify our individual strengths.

Programs: Visual Studio Code.
Languages: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.
Frameworks: Bootstrap.
Libraries: jQuery.
